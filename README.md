# RotateState

This repository contains an Android app using Java that I was required to do for my Mobile Computing class at Valparaiso University. This should reflect my understand of the Java programming language in Android Studios and my ability to use it. 

This specific app demonstrates how the app lifecycle is impacted by the rotation of a device screen.
